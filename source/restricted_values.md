## quality

|quality||
| :--- | :--- |
|5|Bedrock geology has been captured from mapping at 1:250,000 or more detailed; Cover sequences and occurrence of seasonal water have been reviewed and classified from ground studies, or aerial or satellite imagery; faults and structural data have been captured; rock outcrop polygon areas have been checked against LIMA or other satellite imagery (accurate to +/-100m); links to a source bibliography are complete. |
|4|Bedrock geology has been captured from mapping at regional scale (mostly less than 1:250,000); Cover sequences and occurrence of seasonal water have been reviewed and classified from aerial or satellite imagery, but there may not be local studies to constrain age; faults and structural data will generally have been captured; rock outcrop polygon areas have been checked against LIMA or other satellite imagery (accurate to +/-200m); links to a source bibliography are complete. |
|3|Bedrock geology has been captured from mapping at regional scale (mostly greater than 1:250,000); Cover sequences and seasonal water have been mapped but information for classification is limited; some faults and structural data have been captured; there has been some checking of rock outcrop polygon areas against satellite imagery (accurate to +/-500m); further links to bibliographic sources could be added. |
|2|Bedrock geology may be well-constrained, or alternatively interpreted at large scale mapping (e.g. greater than 1:1,000,000); There has been very limited review of cover sequences and seasonal water; faults and structural data are unlikely to have been captured; rock outcrop polygon areas could be improved by checking against satellite imagery (only accurate to +/-1000m). |
|1|Quality rank refers to the early stages of work where little or no information has been attributed to rock outcrop polygons; and polygons have not been checked for their locational position and/or shape. In some places there is no information to assign (where outcrops may not have been visited or had geology inferred) in which case polygons have been attributed as ‘unknown’. There are no places where an entire 1 degree grid polygon is unknown, so GeoMAP v.2022-08 does not have any areas quality = 1. |
|0|No mapable geological feature is recorded in this area.|
