SOURCECODE,"A value indicating the geologic identity of the polygon. This is the code or classification initially assigned by a map author (source) pulled directly from the SOURCE publication, following whatever convention was used by the author in their original publication. Values generally follow conventional geological labels (1-2 characters indicating age followed by 1-2 characters indicating lithology) or they can be a number or character-number combination like a sample Identifier. Question marks in the symbol indicate uncertainty in the original author’s identification.  ",Derived from publication listed in SOURCE  ,Determined by original publication authors  ,,SOURCECODE_values.md,Unrestricted
MAPSYMBOL,"A value indicating the principal geological identity of the polygon. Values are restricted by the formatting convention defined by the GeoMAP legend, using CAPITAL letters representing AGE (Chronostratigraphic subdivision) and small letters representing lithology (rock-type as a lithostratigraphic classification). MAPSYMBOL is used to unify original SOURCECODE and classify polygons consistently across the entire GeoMAP dataset.",Value based on the compiler's interpretation of publication listed in SOURCE that conforms to the GeoMap Legend included in download zip,The first one or two UPPERCASE characters represent the geological time period. The last lowercase character is a code corresponding to the type of geologic unit as defined in the legend. NOTE: Geological units which span multiple time periods have symbols showing the oldest and youngest time periods. e.g. Cambrian to Ordovician sedimentary rocks = EOs; Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic high grade metamorphics = LMn   ,,MAPSYMBOL_values.md,See legend
PLOTSYMBOL,"A value that is generally the same as MAPSYMBOL.  PLOTSYMBOL is used for cartographic purposes to generate colour, or symbols on hard-copy maps. Enables greater user-control. Hs, Qs, Jd are examples where Holocene and Quaternary sediments, or Jurassic dolerites, are differentiated with different PLOTSYMBOL from MAPSYMBOL. ",Value based on the compiler's interpretation of publication listed in SOURCE that conforms to the GeoMap Legend included in download zip,Determined by GeoMAP dataset compilers,,PLOTSYMBOL_values.md,Unrestricted
NAME,"A textual name of the rock unit or simplified type of rock. Where possible the formally defined and published stratigraphic name is adopted, however many units have been named informally or only classified by lithology.  NAME is generally pulled from the SOURCE publication and follows whatever convention is established by the authors.  ",Copied from publication listed in SOURCE,Determined by original publication authors  ,,NAME_values.md,Unrestricted
DESCR,"A description of the geological mapping unit that the polygon is identified as. Geological maps can be based on lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, age, and rock types, or combinations of these. A lithostratigraphic approach has generally been adopted for GeoMAP. Mapping units are based on age and/or rock type. DESCR provides a text description of the range and/or most common rock-types encountered, typically taken from an entry on a geological map legend.
