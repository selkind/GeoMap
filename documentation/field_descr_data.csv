SOURCECODE,A value indicating the geologic identity of the polygon. This is pulled directly from the SOURCE publication and follows whatever convention is used by the author. Values can follow conventional geological labels (1-2 characters indicating age followed by 1-2 characters indicating lithology) or they can be a number or character-number combination like a sample Identifier. Question marks in the symbol indicate uncertainty in the original author’s identification.,Copied from publication listed in SOURCE,Determined by publication authors,https://www.gns.cri.nz/static/datadict/htm/geol_units_pat.htm,SOURCECODE_values.md,Unrestricted
